# Resty, an Objective-C HTTP framework

Resty is a simple to use HTTP library for Cocoa* and iOS apps, aimed at consuming RESTful web services and APIs. 

It uses modern Objective-C language features like blocks to simple asynchronous requests without having to worry about threads, operation queues or repetitive delegation. It is inspired heavily by [RestClient](http://github.com/archiloque/rest-client), a Ruby HTTP library.

For more information and documentation, [check out the project website](http://projects.lukeredpath.co.uk/resty/).

*A Mac build of the framework is not currently available

## Getting started

Resty is distributed as a static framework for iOS; this makes it easy to get up and running with Resty. Simply drop the framework into your project (like any other framework) and add the -ObjC and -all_load linker flags to your target. If your project builds, you should be ready to go.

[Now go and read the documentation](http://projects.lukeredpath.co.uk/documentation.html).
